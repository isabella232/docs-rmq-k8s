## <a id="#errors"></a>Troubleshoot Errors

If you are responding to a specific error or error message, refer to the following sections:

+ [Pods Are Not Being Created](#no-pods)
+ [Pods Are Stuck in Terminating State](#not-terminating-pods)

    symptom: "After creating a RabbitMQ instance,
    it is not available within a few minutes and RabbitMQ Pods do not run.",
    cause: "Common reasons for such failure are: <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li> Incorrect <code>imagePullSecret</code> configuration.
          This prevents the image from being pulled from a Docker registry.</li>

    solution: " To resolve this issue:
          <br><br>
          <ol>
            <li>Correct the <code>imagePullSecret</code> and <code>storageClassName</code>
            configurations. See <a href='./using.html#image-pull-secret'>imagePullSecret</a>,

            <li>
              Contact pivotal-cf-feedback@pivotal.io for assistance and
              provide the information you gather from the previous step.

## <a id='ts-install'></a> Troubleshoot the Installation

This section lists troubleshooting techniques for
checking that you can provision an instance with
<%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>).

### <a id='check-instance-status'></a> Check the Status of an Instance

To check if an instance is running and see information about it:

1. View the status of an instance by running

    ```
    kubectl -n NAMESPACE get all
    ```

    Where `NAMESPACE` is the Kubernetes namespace of the instance. <br><br>

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
      $ kubectl -n p-rmq-instance-1 get all
      NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
      pod/pivotal-rabbitmq-server-0   1/1     Running   0          2m27s

      NAME                                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                        AGE
      service/pivotal-rabbitmq-headless   ClusterIP   None             <none>        4369/TCP                       2m27s
      service/pivotal-rabbitmq-ingress    ClusterIP   10.111.202.183   <none>        5672/TCP,15672/TCP,15692/TCP   2m28s

      NAME                                       READY   AGE
      statefulset.apps/pivotal-rabbitmq-server   1/1     2m28s
    </pre>
