## <a id="0-7-0"></a> v0.7.0

**Release Date: March 27, 2020**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* A Helm chart to deploy RabbitmqCluster is now available
* You can now install <%= vars.product_short %> by using a Helm chart, if you have access to a <%= vars.product_network %> image registry.
For more information, see [Installing <%= vars.product_short %> Using a Helm Chart](./installing-with-helm.html).
* You can use the Helm chart to integrate with KSM. For more information, see [Using with Container Service Manager](ksm.html).
* A dedicated service broker is no longer included. Use KSM for OSBAPI integration.
* Nodes now have a pre-stop check that prevents nodes from stopping if doing so would lead to a quorum loss.
* RabbitMQ is upgraded to v3.8.3. This version contains an important fix to correctly handle SIGTERM.
* The RabbitmqCluster resource now has a status field to expose the status of RabbitmqCluster.
* The documentation now describes how to monitor with PodMonitor instead of ServiceMonitor.<br>
Pods are removed from the service endpoints when Pod termination is triggered, which creates a gap in the metrics.<br>
PodMonitor bridges this gap by scraping the Pods during the shutdown process.<br>
For more information, see [Monitor RabbitMQ Using the Prometheus Operator](monitoring.html#prom-operator).

### Known Issues

* A pre-stop check might cause Pods to get stuck in the terminating state. For more information, see
[Pods Are Stuck in the Terminating State](troubleshooting.html#not-terminating-pods).
* This version is not compatible with KSM v0.7. Support is planned for the next version.
