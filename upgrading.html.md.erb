Product upgrades are currently not supported. To test a newer version, uninstall the previous version first.

## <a id='uninstall-manifests'></a> Uninstall Through the Manifests

To uninstall the product if it was installed through the Kubernetes manifests, run these commands:

  ```
  kubectl delete rabbitmqclusters --all --all-namespaces
  kubectl wait --for delete pod -l "app.kubernetes.io/component=rabbitmq" --all-namespaces --timeout=300s
  ```

  If the command `kubectl wait` fails with an error similar to the following, please contact us:

  ```
  error: timed out waiting for the condition on pods/example-rabbitmq-server-0
  ```

  The command `kubectl wait` will return a success message similar to:

  ```
  pod/example-rabbitmq-server-0 condition met
  ```

  After getting a successful message, run:

  ```
  cd rabbitmq-for-kubernetes-$version
  kubectl delete -f manifests/
  ```
