## <a id="0-7-0"></a> v0.7.0

**Release Date: March 24, 2020**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* A Helm chart to deploy RabbitmqCluster is now available
* The Helm chart can be used to integrate with KSM, [see KSM page for more details](ksm.html)
* A dedicated service broker is no longer included - please use KSM for OSBAPI integration
* Nodes have a pre-stop check now - the node should not be stopped if that would lead to a quorum loss
* RabbitMQ upgraded to 3.8.3. This version contains an important fix to correctly handle SIGTERM
* RabbitmqCluster resource now has a Status field to expose the status of RabbitmqCluster
* [Monitoring page](monitoring.html) has been updated to use PodMonitor rather than ServiceMonitor. Pods are removed from the service endpoints when pod termination is triggered, which led to a gap in the metrics. PodMonitor keeps scraping the pods during the shutdown process.

### Known Issues

* Pre-stop check may lead to pods being left in the terminating state. See [troubleshooting page](troubleshooting.html#not-terminating-pods) for more details.
* This version is not compatible with KSM 0.7. Support will be added in the next version.
