title: Using Pivotal RabbitMQ for Kubernetes with Pivotal Platform
owner: RMQ for k8s

This topic describes how to use <%= vars.product_full %> with Pivotal Platform and Cloud Foundry.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

You can use <%= vars.product_short %> to:

1. [Confirm Service Availability](#marketplace)
1. [Create a Service Instance](#create)
1. [Bind Your Service Instance to an App](#binding)
1. [Use the RabbitMQ Service in Your App](#use)
1. [Unbind a Service Instance From Your App](#unbind)
1. [Delete a Service Instance](#delete)

## <a id='availability'></a>Confirm Service Availability

For an app to use a service, the service must be available in the Marketplace for its space.

To confirm this availability:

1. Run `cf marketplace`.
1. Check that `p-rabbitmq-k8s` is in the `service` column. If it is, <%= vars.product_short %> is available. If it is not, ask your operator to install it.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf marketplace
    Getting services from marketplace in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    service      plans         description
    [...]
    p-rabbitmq-k8s   single, ha   RabbitMQ on K8s
    [...]
    </pre>

## <a id='create'></a>Create a Service Instance

For an app to use a service, an instance of the service must exist in its space.
Services are created asynchronously, not immediately.
The `watch` command shows you when your service instance is ready to bind and use.

To create an instance of the <%= vars.product_short %> service:

1. Check to see if there is an existing service by running:

    ```
    cf services
    ```
    Look for instances that have `p-rabbitmq-k8s` in the `service` column.
    If there is an existing instance that you want to use, skip to the [Bind a Service Instance to Your App](#bind) section below.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf services
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service          plan          bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p-rabbitmq-k8s   ha                          create succeeded
    </pre>

1. Create the service instance by running:

    ```
    cf create-service p-rabbitmq-k8s HA SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```

    Where:
    + `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is a name you choose to identify the service instance.
    This name appears under `name` in the output from `cf services`.
    + `HA` is the plan.
    You can replace it with any of the other plans listed in the Marketplace for the
    `p-rabbitmq-k8s` service.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ cf create-service p-rabbitmq-k8s single-node my-instance
    Creating service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK</pre>

1. Check that the process was successful by running:

    ```
    watch cf services
    ```

    If successful, `last operation` for your instance is reported as `create succeeded`.<br><br>

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ watch cf services
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service        plan           bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p-rabbitmq-k8s ha                           create succeeded
    </pre>

    If `create succeeded` does not appear within a few minutes, follow the relevant steps in [Troubleshooting <%= vars.product_full %>](./troubleshooting.html#failed-instance).

## <a id='binding'></a> Bind Your Service Instance to an App

For an app to use a service, you must bind it to a service instance.
Do this after you push or re-push the app using `cf push`.

1. To bind an app to a RabbitMQ instance, run:

    ```
    cf bind-service APP SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```

    Where `APP` is the app you want to use the RabbitMQ service instance and `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name you supplied when you ran `cf create-service`.

    See an example below.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf bind-service my-app my-instance<br>
    Binding service mydb to my-app in org my-org / space test as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    </pre>

## <a id='use'></a> Use the RabbitMQ Service in Your App

<%# CAN WE HAVE A CALL TO ACTION IN THIS SECTION? HOW DO I USE THIS INFO TO MODIFY MY APPS OR DO OTHER THINGS? DO WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH CONNECTION STRINGS? CREDENTIALS?%>

For information about how to start using RabbitMQ in your apps, see the [RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html).

Apps running in Cloud Foundry gain access to the bound service instances through an environment variable called `VCAP_SERVICES`.

Apps that have been bound to a service instance can read `VCAP_SERVICES` from their environment.
To see the `VCAP_SERVICES` for an app, run `cf env APP-NAME` with the name of an app bound to the <%= vars.product_short %> instance.
An example hash is shown below:

  ```json
  {
      "p-rabbitmq-k8s": [{
        "binding_name": null,
        "credentials": {

## <a id="unbind"></a> Unbind a Service Instance From Your App

1. To stop an app from using a service it no longer needs, unbind it from the service instance by running:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf unbind-service APP SERVICE-INSTANCE
    </pre>

    Where `APP` is the app you want to stop using the RabbitMQ service instance and `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name you supplied when you ran `cf create-service`.<br><br>

    See an example below.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf unbind-service my-app my-instance<br>
    Unbinding app my-app from service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    </pre>

## <a id="delete"></a> Delete a Service Instance

To delete a service instance, use `cf delete-service`.

1. Run `cf delete-service SERVICE-INSTANCE`, where `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of the service to delete. See an example below.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf delete-service my-instance<br>
    Are you sure you want to delete the service my-instance ? y
    Deleting service my-service in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    </pre>

1. Run `watch cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE` and wait for a `Service instance not found` error indicating that the instance no longer exists.

You cannot delete a service instance that an app is bound to.
